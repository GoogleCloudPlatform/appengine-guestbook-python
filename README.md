# Guestbook

Guestbook is an example application showing basic usage of Google App
Engine. Users can read & write text messages and optionally log-in with
their Google account. Messages are stored in App Engine (NoSQL)
High Replication Datastore (HRD) and retrieved using a strongly consistent
(ancestor) query.

## E2E Test for this sample app

A Makefile is provided to deploy and run the e2e test.

To run:

     export GAE_PROJECT=your-project-id
     make

To manually run, install the requirements

    pip install -r e2e/requirements-dev.txt

Set the environment variable to point to your deployed app:

    export GUESTBOOK_URL="http://guestbook-test-dot-useful-temple-118922.appspot.com/"

Finally, run the test

    python e2e/test_e2e.py
    
## Deploy to App Engine
Deploy this from a terminal with the Google Cloud SDK installed.

The index.yaml needs to be built first by running:
     
     gcloud app deploy index.yaml
     
Wait for indexes to build in datastore then run:

     gcloud app deploy app.yaml
